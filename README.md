Darts Game
Darts Game is a Java application that allows players to enjoy a game of darts. The application includes a variety of features, including darts accounting, customization, user profiles, self-challenge, bot challenge, CLI application, GUI application, and web application.

Features
Darts Accounting: The system can handle accounting for a complete round of darts between multiple players or teams. The system clearly communicates whose turn it is and takes score input from them. The system also communicates the finish of the round. This is the core feature of the application and is the first iteration that should take about two weeks to complete.

Darts Customization: The system can load and use custom settings for a round, including attributes of the dartboard such as section scores and multipliers. This feature is heavily intertwined with the Darts Accounting requirement and is the unique selling point of the application.

Export/Import Custom Settings: The system can export and import the settings from Darts Customization as a common file format such as JSON or XML. This feature supplements the unique selling point of the application.

User Profile: The system keeps a record of some number of users' most recent, best, or worst playthroughs. This feature enables further features such as allowing users to play against their past performance or displaying users some stats about their playthroughs.
Challenge Self: The system allows the user to play against their previous performance, making use of data from the User Profile feature.
Challenge Bot: The system allows the user to play against a bot opponent, which provides different difficulty settings for the bot. The bot is a simple, probability-based model.
CLI Application: The system interacts with the user through the command line, allowing the developers to test the functionality of other requirements without building a GUI.
GUI Application: The system interacts with the user through a Java desktop application, which is the primary means for the user to interact with the application.
Web Application: The system interacts with the user through a web application, which is a stretch goal and has a low priority.
